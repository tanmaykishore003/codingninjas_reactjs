You are part of a development team who is building a digital image gallery, where Image URLs would be used to display the images.

You have been assigned the following tasks to complete the app -

- Whenever the site is visited, i.e., whenever the application is mounted, the images should be fetched from the local storage and displayed on the screen.

- When you enter the Image URL, it must be stored in the device’s local storage.

- The Image list should not be updated if the URL contains some spaces or has a length of fewer than five characters.

You don’t need to worry about invalid URLs as it has already been handled by your team member.

Expected Output -
<img src=”https://res.cloudinary.com/dzi9rcqsa/image/upload/v1675830308/ImageAdder_bfqbmu.gif” />
