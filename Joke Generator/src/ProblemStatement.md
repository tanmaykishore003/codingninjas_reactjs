You and your friend are building a joke generator.

While building the application, your friend realises that many API requests would be required to be made in different components.

So he has asked you to make a custom hook for fetching jokes that returns the joke data, loading status, error, and a function to fetch new jokes.

- Display "Loading..." when fetching data
- Display "Something went wrong" on error.
- Clicking the "New Joke" button should display a new joke.

Note:- The given boilerplate code must be used to render jokes fetched from an API.
